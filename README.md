# Two-phase-V-S-Four-phase-Signaling
## Compare the effectiveness of two-phase vs. four-phase signal timing.
Setup:
  Use the same intersection as Exercise 1.1.
  Traffic Flow: Increase vehicle flow to 1000 vehicles/hour for north-south and
700 vehicles/hour for east-west.
  Task:
▪ Set up two configurations: a two-phase signal (alternating green lights
for NS and EW) and a four-phase signal (each approach gets a
separate green phase).
▪ Phasing Configurations:
▪ Two-Phase Setup:
▪ Phase 1 (North-South): Green = 30 seconds, Yellow = 5 seconds, Red
= 25 seconds.
▪ Phase 2 (East-West): Green = 30 seconds, Yellow = 5 seconds, Red =
25 seconds.
▪ Four-Phase Setup (each approach has its own green phase):
▪ Phase 1 (Northbound): Green = 15 seconds, Yellow = 5 seconds, Red
= 40 seconds.
▪ Phase 2 (Southbound): Green = 15 seconds, Yellow = 5 seconds, Red
= 40 seconds.
▪ Phase 3 (Eastbound): Green = 15 seconds, Yellow = 5 seconds, Red =
40 seconds.
▪ Phase 4 (Westbound): Green = 15 seconds, Yellow = 5 seconds, Red
= 40 seconds.
▪ Run simulations to compare queue length and delays for each setup.
o Outputs to Collect: Average wait times, throughput, and comparison of delays
in each configuration.
